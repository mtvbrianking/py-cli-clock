# This file specifies the dependencies that are needed by this project and
# that would also be needed by another project that depends on this project.
#
# Specifically, this file is fed into `install_requires` in `setup.py`.
# This file should contain ranges of requirements, not pinned versions.
#
# It should contain only direct dependencies, not transitive dependencies.
# When you update this file run;
#
#     `pip-compile requirements.in -o requiremts.txt`
#
# to automatically update `requirements.txt`.
